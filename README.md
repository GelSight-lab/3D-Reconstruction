# 3D-Reconstruction

Poisson reconstruction for any curved surfaces and fisheye cameras

## Features

- Reconstruction on any surface based on fisheye camera projection
- Reconstruction using difference image
- FFT-baed Fast prossion solver
- 

## To do

- [ ] Reconstruction using difference image
- [ ] GPU version
- [ ] User-defined fisheye (or other camera) projection
- [ ] Find the optimal boundary condition to solve with (optional)
- [ ] Contact region detecting to decrease the of the problem
- [ ] Error analysis
- [ ] Document (why does not gradient transformation from spherical coordinate to polar coordinate have a sin(\theta) coordinate?)
